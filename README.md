 # Rainfall-Prediction
The prediction of rainfall, which has major implications for several sectors including
agriculture, water management, and disaster planning, is an essential issue in climate
science. The old approaches to estimating rainfall often are based on historical data and
Statistical Models, which can pose difficulties in understanding the complex connection of
climate factors with precipitation patterns. In order to predict rainfall using meteorological
factors, we propose a novel Deep Learning methodology based on hierarchical clustering
analysis in this article. The proposed method allows for the inclusion of strong learning
capabilities coupled with knowledge from hierarchical clustering, which can capture time
and spatial relationships between climate variables. Inputs from groupings of related
meteorological patterns, which have been identified using Deep Learning, are received in the
model. This has allowed a model to learn the complex links between those patterns and rainfall, resulting in greater accuracy of forecasts. We ran experiments utilizing a sizable dataset of historical climate factors and matching
rainfall measurements to assess the efficacy of the suggested technique. The outcomes show
that, for rainfall forecasting, our system beats both conventional techniques and other cutting-edge deep learning models. The enhanced forecasting accuracy is a result of the hierarchical
clustering technique, which offers useful insights into the underlying structure of the
meteorological variables.
